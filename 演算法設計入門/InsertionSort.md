Insertion Sort 

1. Insertion sort is a little bit more efficient than bubble sort in practice. Theoreically, they have the same Big O value( O(n)2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ).
2. The principle of insertion sort is simple. Keeping insering a new value into a sorted array. Insert it to the correct spot so the sorted array remains sorted.
