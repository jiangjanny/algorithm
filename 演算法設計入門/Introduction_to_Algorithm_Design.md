# List of Algorithms

## Linear Search (Sequental Search)

It's an slorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Probably the easily algorithm we will learn in this course.

In our codeing practice, we will try      to find a number inside an array. If the number could be found, then return the index. If not, then return -1.

1. Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
2. More efficient then linear search, but only works with sorted data set.
3. In our coding praction, we will have a sorted array, and one number we want to find inside this sorted array, If the number could be found, then return the index.If not , then return -1

## Counter

## Pointer

## Sliding Window

## Recursion
